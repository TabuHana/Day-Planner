## Day Planner

This is a simple day planner that allows the user to store their plans for the day by hour stored locally so that their data persists even after the page 
is refreshed. The user can type their plans out and as the time passes it will show which even is current, past and future. I used JQuery to allow for 
functionality in the app.
